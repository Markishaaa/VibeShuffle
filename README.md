# VibeShuffle - Your Gym Workout Companion

VibeShuffle is an Android app designed to enhance your gym workouts by seamlessly integrating with the Spotify API. With VibeShuffle, you can effortlessly switch between two Spotify playlists, one for chilling and one for getting in the zone during your workout sessions. This README will guide you through the app's features, setup, and usage.

## Features

- **Playlist Selection**: Choose two playlists from your Spotify account - one with casual, chill songs and another with more aggressive tracks to match your workout intensity.

- **Shuffle and Switch**: Play random songs from the selected playlists with a tap of a button. Easily switch between the chill and aggressive playlists to keep your workout energy levels up.

- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume independently for each playlist. Customize your experience by setting lower volume for the chill playlist during rest periods and higher volume for the aggressive playlist when you're hitting the weights.

- **Playlist Preview**: View the contents of each playlist you've selected to ensure they match your mood and workout goals.

- **Playlist Customization**: If you ever get tired of your current playlists, easily swap them out for fresh tracks to keep your workouts exciting.
